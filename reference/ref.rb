### EXAMPLE basic window

class GameWindow < Gosu::Window
  # The constructor initializes the Gosu::Window base class. The parameters shown here create a 640x480 pixels large window. It also sets the caption of the window, which is displayed in its title bar.
    # You can create a fullscreen window by passing :fullscreen => true after the width and height.
  # Gosu::Image#initialize takes two arguments, the filename and an (optional) options hash. Here we set :tileable to true.
  # Basically, you should use :tileable => true for background images and map tiles.
  def initialize
    super 640, 480
    # :fullscreen => true
    self.caption = "Gosu Tutorial Game"
  end

  # update() and draw() are overrides of Gosu::Window's methods.
  def update
    # main game loop
    # update() is called 60 times per second (by default) and should contain the main game logic: move objects, handle collisions...
  end

  def draw
    # draw() is called afterwards and whenever the window needs redrawing for other reasons,
      # and may also be skipped every other time if the FPS go too low.
    # It should contain the code to redraw the whole screen, but no updates to the game's state.
  end
end

window = GameWindow.new
# Then follows the main program. We create a window and call its show() method,
  # which does not return until the window has been closed by the user or by calling close().
window.show
